  This indicates maximum no of occupants can share a room. If a room is taken
  by a family/staff or a student does not want to share, even though the room
  capacity is more than 1, room will not be shared by anyone else. <br>
  All the expenses(rental/electricity/water bill and other charges) for the room
  will be posted to the no of occupants.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Total Occupants as of today</strong><br>
This indicates total no of Occupants for the selected room as of this day. This can't be more than maximum capacity of room. Room
status is OCCUPIED once the room reached maximum no of occupant capacity. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Remaining no of Occupants</strong><br>

posted is devided among the occupants.
