            <h1 class="title" id="7_0">Employee Recognition Program</h1>
            <p>Lighthouse is committed to valuing and recognizing its most valuable asset-its employees. While there are numerous informal ways to recognize employees, the recognition programs described below allow you to provide special recognition to one or all of your employees or to an employee who does not report to you. </p>

            <h2 class="title" id="7_1">Salamat (Thank You) Award</h2>
            <p>A Management Appreciation Award is presented by a Manager to an employee or group of employees who have demonstrated exemplary performance and/or behavior outside of the normal job assignment. The behavior should be very significant and unusual to merit the recognition.</p>
            <p>You are required to get the approval from your local Manager and European management, specifying the name of the employee(s) and the reason for the award. When approved, a copy must be submitted to HR for the employee(s)' records/file.</p>
            <p>After your request has been approved, you may proceed with requesting the cash reward from Finance . The cash amount shall be charged to the account of the requesting Manager's department.</p>
            <p>If you wish to recognize employees reporting to another Manager, you should contact the employee's Manager prior to presenting the award to the employee. Together with the employee's immediate Manager, both of you decide on when and how to present the award.</p>
            <p>A cash award of 2,000 (net of tax) is given to the employee or to each employee if there are two or more of them. This may be presented during a department staff meeting which gives you an opportunity to recognize an employee's outstanding efforts in front of his/her peers. However, in some situations, it may be more appropriate to present the award in a private meeting with the employee.</p>

            <h2 class="title" id="7_2">Team Outing/ Recognition</h2>
            <p>Each manager has the opportunity to spend some amount per employee per year for recognition events like celebrating project accomplishments, team bonding activities, etc… The amount may be spent by areas/groups or departments. The manager must submit to the European management the  planned team activity , justification and the budget needed. Examples of acceptable spending:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lunchout or dinner out</li>
                <li>A bowling game or a movie together</li>
                <li>Other wholesome activities where the team can develop better camaraderie and closer team relationship</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is expected that you will exercise due diligence in selecting the kind of activity your team will undergo within reasonable frequency and cost.</p>

            <h1 class="title" id="8_0">Compensation Policy and Practices</h1>

            <p>Compensation plays a key role in the company’s efforts to attract, retain and motivate employees. </p>

            <h2 class="title" id="8_1">Transfers and Promotions</h2>

            <p>Lateral transfers can happen in either of two ways:</p>

            <p><em class="title" id="8_3_1">Management-initiated</em> - Transfer of an employee from one area to another maybe effected at your initiative , if it will mean better utilization of the employee's talents and training.</p>

            <p>Promotion can occur at anytime of the year.

            <h1 class="title" id="15_0">Objectives of Disciplinary Action</h1>

            <p>Disciplinary action measures generally are imposed to correct, reform or
            rehabilitate the employee and to maintain a general standard of
            discipline in the company.</p>

            <p>Disciplinary action as a general rule shall be progressively applied depending
            upon the seriousness of the offense and the entire record of the
            employee&rsquo;s performance.</p>

            <h2 class="title" id="15_1">Type of Disciplinary Action</h2>

            <p>Depending on the history, circumstances and gravity of the offense/situation,
            progressive disciplinary action may be applied in the following
            form/types of disciplinary action:</p>

            <p><em class="title" id="15_1_1">Corrective Counselling</em> -
            this refers to the formal discussion of the supervisor
            with the employee concerned. The discussion would focus on getting
            the facts of the violation and the reason for the violation.  Proper
            counseling which is done in private thereafter takes place after all
            the facts and issues are discussed openly.  The discussion and
            counseling should be documented properly.</p>

            <p><em class="title" id="15_1_2">Written Warning</em> -
            a written warning is given when corrective counseling
            fails.  This will warn the employee in writing that repetition of the
            same offense will result in a heavier penalty such as suspension or
            dismissal.  Supporting documents or report of the violators must be
            attached to the disciplinary action form as documentation of the
            discussion of violation.</p>

            <p><em class="title" id="15_1_3">Suspension</em> -
            this is compulsory and temporary absence from work on a no-pay
            status. Implementing suspension as a disciplinary action should be
            done after thorough evaluation of the full merits of the case is
            done. A suspension can be from 1 day up to a maximum of 30 days,
            depending on the gravity of the offense.</p>
            
            <p><em class="title" id="15_1_4">Dismissal</em> -
            this is the most serious form of employee discipline, which only
            becomes necessary when all attempts to correct the misdemeanor have
            failed, except, in cases where dismissal is resorted to specifically,
            as per Code of Conduct.  This must be resorted to only after thorough
            and factual investigation have been done, in consultation with the HR
            Manager and european management. The following are examples of
            violations that is sanctionable to immediate dismissal or termination
            from work : Theft of company property or intellectual property,
            sexual harassment and other violations which can be criminal in
            nature.
            </p>

            <p>Progressive
            discipline, however, does not apply to grave offenses for which the
            employee may be discharged immediately.  As a further action, the
            Company may institute the necessary civil and/or criminal case
            against the employee.</p>

                        A written notice shall be served by the Company to the employee and
                        shall specify therein the specific provision/s of the Code violated,
                        the date, time and manner of violation, if readily ascertained, and
                        shall require the employee to explain and/or show cause why no
                        disciplinary action shall be taken against him/her.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The employee shall be given forty eight (48) hours or such number of
                        hours as may be reasonable, to submit his/her written explanation to
                        the first written notice.  Upon receipt of the written explanation,
                        the Company shall determine whether or not the explanation is
                        satisfactory. The failure of the employee to submit his written
                        explanation within the prescribed period shall be considered a waiver
                        of his/her right to answer the charges against him/her.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the written explanation is not satisfactory, the Company shall make
                        its decision in writing, making a brief finding therein and shall
                        serve a copy thereof to the employee.

                    <li>
                        Where the penalty is termination/dismissal, the Company shall conduct a
                        formal investigation by sending a written notice of investigation to
                        the employee specifying the date, place and time of investigation,
                        and shall further require his presence thereat, with the assistance
                        of his representative or counsel, if he/she so desires. The failure
                        of the employee to attend this investigation without justifiable
                        excuse shall be considered a waiver of his/her right to adduce
                        evidence in his/her defense.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        the charges leveled against him/her. The Company shall have the sole
                        discretion to terminate the formal investigation.

                    <li>
                        After the termination of the formal investigation, the Company shall assess
                        and evaluate the evidence and determine whether or not the employee
                        is guilty thereof, and to impose therein the appropriate penalty/ies.
                        The decision of the Company shall be in writing and shall be served
                        to the employee concerned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The written notices/decisions shall be served to the employee personally,
                        if present, or if not possible, by sending the same at the last known
                        address of the employee as indicated in the latter's employment

                    <li>
                        In the actual imposition of penalty/ies, the Company shall consider
                        such factors as may be reasonable such as previous infraction, first
                        offense, length of service, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An employee may be placed under preventive suspension when the
                        continued employment of the employee poses a serious and imminent
                        threat to the life or property of the employer or of his
                        co-employees. No preventive suspension shall last longer than 30
                        days. The Company shall thereafter reinstate the employee to his
                        former or in a substantially equivalent position or the employer may
                        extend the period of suspension provided during the period of
                        extension, he pays the wages and other benefits due to the employee.
                        In such case, the employee shall not be bound to reimburse the
                        amount paid to him/her during the extension if the Company decided
                        after completion of the investigation, to dismiss the employee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the termination of employment is brought about by the failure of a
                        probationary employee to meet the standards for regularization set
                        by the Company, it shall be sufficient that a written notice of such
                        termination is served to the employee within a reasonable time (15
                        to 30 days) prior to the effective date of termination.
